## Type

What is the type of foo?

    let foo = fun x -> let (y,z) = x in z - y;;

Function      ==> Tx -> Tout
let (y,z) = x ==> Ty * Tz = Tx
z - y         ==> Tz = Ty = int

==> foo: int * int -> int

    let rec cat xs =
      match xs with
        | []      -> cat []
        | x::xs'  -> x ^ (cat xs')


Txs = Tbody
Txs = Tsomething list
Tx = Tsomething
Tx = string
Tbody = string

Even when the code falls into infinite loop.
Since compiler does not run the code, it does decide the type.

    let rec map f xs = 
      match xs with 
        | []        ->  []
        | x::xs'    -> (f x)::(map f xs')

Tf -> Txs -> Tbody
Txs = Tsomething list
Tbody = Tanother list
Tx = Tsomething
Txs' = Tsomething list
Tf = Tsomething -> Tfout
Tfout = Tanther

(Tsomthing -> Tanother) -> Tsomething list -> Tanother list
('a -> 'b) -> '

### Pipe function

    <+>
 
    let (<+>) f g x = g (f x)

Tf -> Tg -> Tx -> Tbody
Tf = Tx -> Tfout
Tg = Tfout -> Tgout
Tbody = Tgout

(Tx -> Tfout) -> (Tfout -> Tbody) -> Tx -> Tbody
('a -> 'b) -> ('b -> 'c) -> 'a -> 'c

By the way, this is equivallent to
('a -> 'b) -> ('b -> 'c) -> ('a -> 'c)

-> is right associative

T1 -> T2 -> T3 -> T4 = (T1 -> (T2 -> (T3 ->T4)))
