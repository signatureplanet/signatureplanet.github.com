## Intro to PA6

   * Decorator as profile
   * ScalaCheck as Bst

object bob `{def apply(x: Int) = x => x }`

## Case class

new can be skipped.

    sealed class IntList
    case class ICons(h: Int, t: IntLost) extends IntList
    case class Nil()		     extends IntList

    val l1 = new INil()  //is the same as
    val l1 = INil()

new can be skipped.


    sealed class IntList
    case class ICons(h: Int, t: IntLost) extends IntList
    case class Nil()		     extends IntList

    val l1 = new INil()  //is the same as
    val l1 = INil()

## Subtyping

structual subtype 

    {def next(): Any
     def hasNext: Boolean }

A type is a contract

    def screenSaver(p: Point) {
      // Only uses properties described in Point
    }

Contract between screenSaver and its Caller.
Callser promises to only send Point values.

What is the Point?

* any object with Point attributes.
* if object has more attributes, no problem.
   * This is called subtyping

    S <: T  //S is a subtype of T

S is less than T if S is T.

S has more attribute than T/

Width Subtyping


Depth subtyping:

    class Line
    {
      val p1: Dot
      val p2: Dot
    }
    class colorLine
    {
      val p1: ColorDot
      val p2: ColorDot
    }

Function subtyping

1. The same input type

    If S <: T then In => S <: In => T

2. The same output type

    If S <: T then T => Out <: S => Out


    plotGraphic(x: Dot => Graphics)

We cannot pass cd2g: ColorDot => Graphics to plotGraphics because gd2g could use properties that only the ColorDot has.
