## Prolog

## Declarative programming
* SQL
* Makefile
* Linear Programming

## For kind of Terms
* Constants
* Atoms
   * An atom is not a variable
   * Element of a sigle mega enum type

	type atoms = x | alice | taco | ...

* Variables
   * start with Upper case
* Compound Terms
   * atom(term1, term2, ...)
   * can be seen as trees

Ocaml type for terms

	type term = Constant of int
		  | Atom of string
		  | Variable of string
		  | Compound of string * term list

	parent(alice, bob) // is equivalent to 
	Compound ("parent", [Atom "alice"; Atom "bob"]) 

"parent" is called as function symbol.

## Unification

	parent(X, kim)  
	parent(bob, kim)

Can we make this two trees the same (unification) by assigning something to `X`? 
## Rules

	grandparent(GP, GC) :- parent(GP, P), parent(P, GC)

1. If you want to prove that GP is grandparent of GC, you have to prove ...
1. If you knowt that GP is a parent of P and P is a parent of GC, GP is a grandparent of GC.
