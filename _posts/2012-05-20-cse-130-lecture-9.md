# Lecture 9: Polymorphism

* Date: 2012-05-01

## Polymorphic Data Types

Type is instantiated for each use.

## Option

    type 'a option = None | Some of 'a

In case of JAVA, returning NULL.  
But it is up to programmer to check the NULL.

In Ocaml, complier make sure that the NULL case is taken care of. 

    let foo (x: int oprion) = match x with 
          | None   -> None
          | Some i -> Some (i + 1)


    type = Num of int | Div of expr * expr
    

    let rec eval e = match e with
      | Num i -> Some i
      | Div (e1, e2) ->
      begin
        let v1 = eval e1 in
        let v2 = eval e2 in
          match (v1, v2) with
            | (Some n, Some d) when d != 0 -> Some (n/d)
            | _ -> None
      end

    let rec lookup key t = match t with
      | Leaf -> None
      | Node (k,v,_,_) when k = key -> Some v
      | Node (k,_,l,r) with k < key -> lookup key r
      | Node (k,_,l,r) with k > key -> lookup key l


* Java, C# generics is borrowed from ML
