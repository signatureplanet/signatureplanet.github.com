* HashMap

    x -> y

is equal to

    (x, y)

    import scala.collection.mutable.HashMap
    val mutMap :HashMap[String, Int] = HashMap()
  
    mutMap += "a" -> 1

    mutMap.+=("a" -> 1)

The following code is collect.  Loot at the "var" in front of immuMap.

{% highlight scala %}
import scala.collection.immutable.HashMap
var immuMap : Map[String, Int] = Map()
immuMap += "mon" -> 1
immuMap += "mon" -> 2
{% endhighlight %}


    var mutMap += x    //Add x to Map
    var immutMap += x  //Create new map and reassign the reference

## HOFS

* All collection objects equipped with HOFs!

    numNames.filter({case (k,v) => })


    val xss = List(List(1,2,3), List(4,5,6))
    for ( xs <- xss; x <- xs) yield x

    val xss = List( "car", "moon")
    for ( xs <- xss; x <- xs) yield x
